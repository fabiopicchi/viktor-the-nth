My dear child Viktor,/breakline=3
We came from a land of ice and snow.
Our family has finally fulfilled an old oath, 
and the land you see before you is their reward for you to enjoy./breakline=5
Just remember, you may be lost, frozen and wounded.
But you will never be alone.
May your path be opened by those before you./breakline=4
Your Father, 
Viktor/breakline=30
