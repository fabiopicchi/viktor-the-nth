My dear child Viktor,/breakline=3
For too long have we lived in this land
of ice and snow.
Our family has sworn to seek evergreen 
fields, in the lands beyond the mountains.
And so I, like many generations before us,
embarked on our journey.
As will be expected of you./breakline=5
Just remember, you may be lost, frozen 
and wounded.
But you will never be alone.
May your path be opened by those before you./breakline=4
Your Father, 
Viktor/breakline=30
